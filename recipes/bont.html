        <h2>What is beans on toast?</h2>
        Beans on toast is life. Enough said. I'll 
        show you how to make some banging B on T.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>BRANSTONS beans</li>
            <li><em>optional</em> cheddar cheese</li>
            <li><em>optional</em> bbq sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Put beans in pan & heat up gently.
                Give them a stir when bubbling and
                occasionally whilst heating to prevent
                sticking to pan. You can also use the
                microwave if you have one.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop a few slices of fresh
                sourdough loaf and pop in the toaster -
                or toast in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Once beans are done, season to taste.
                If desired cheese and let it melt and/or
                add bbq sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Butter the bread shortly after it is
                toasted to melt butter.
            </li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
