        <h2>What is pasta?</h2>
       Are you <strong>crazy?</strong> <em>You don't know what pasta is?!</em>
        <p>I'll assume you're kidding and we'll proceed.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Packet of pasta</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Process</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a pan with water and bring to a boil</li>
            <li>Heavily salt the water. Allow it to
                all dissolve. Try get it to taste as salty
                as the sea.
            </li>
            <li>Take the pasta out of the packet -
                careful not to break any here - and
                place into the boiling water.
            </li>
            <li>Let it cook for a few minutes, checking
                to see if it is al dente.
            </li>
            <li>Once done, add to any pasta sauce of your
                choice.
            </li>
        </ol>
